# daily-mood-react

Hi!

Let me introduce first version of my application. 
Using calendar you can track, for example, your physical activity or mood throughout the year. 

Now I use React+Redux+Node+MongoDb stack, but plan to refactor it on rxjs. Now it's really interesting thing for me. 
I also wanted to try another stack for this app, for example GraphQl for backend and Angular or Vue for client but I'm not sure it would be usefull now. :) But sure I'll try.
