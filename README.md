# daily-mood-react

## Hey!


Let me introduce first version of my application. 
Using calendar you can track, for example, your physical activity or mood throughout the year. You just mark each day with color or picture. 

Now I use React+Redux+Node+MongoDb+Bootstrap stack, but plan to refactor it on rxjs. Now it's really interesting thing for me. I use Postman for testing backend. 
I also wanted to try another stack for this app, for example GraphQl for backend and Angular or Vue for client but I'm not sure it would be usefull now. :) But sure I'll try.

(May, 15 I did it! Now I use Angular)

This is 3rd version of Daily-mood. 
-v 3
